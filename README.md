# Luca: Lasting Unity for conservation and awareness
## 📌 Overview
Luca is a strategic simulation game where players take on the role of a global advisor tackling climate change. Players acquire countries, implement policies, and make strategic decisions to reduce global CO₂ emissions and reach net-zero. The game educates players on real-world environmental policies and how different initiatives impact the climate.

## 🎯 Motivation
Our goal was to create an engaging and educational tool that demonstrates how policy changes influence carbon emissions on a global scale. By simulating real-world emissions data and climate strategies, Luca allows players to explore and understand the complexities of reducing global CO₂ output.

## 🛠️ How It Works
Players purchase countries to take control of their environmental policies.
Each country has unique energy sources, economic constraints, and climate policies that affect emissions.
Players implement strategies such as switching to renewable energy, imposing carbon taxes, or investing in green technology.
The game simulates the effects of these decisions on global emissions, with the goal of reaching net-zero CO₂ output.

## 🚀 How to Run It
Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js & npm (for frontend)
Python (for backend)
MongoDB (database)
Installation & Setup
Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/luca-climate-game.git
cd luca-climate-game
Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend folder:

cd backend
Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Start the backend server:
```
python app.py
```
Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend folder:
```
cd frontend

Use MongoDB Atlas if hosting the database remotely.
Running the Game
Once the backend and frontend servers are running, open your browser and navigate to:


http://localhost:3000
From here, you can start acquiring countries and implementing climate policies!

## 🔮 Future Plans
