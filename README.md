# Luca: Lasting Unity for conservation and awareness
## 📌 Overview
Luca is a strategic simulation game where players take on the role of a global advisor tackling climate change. Players acquire countries, implement policies, and make strategic decisions to reduce global CO₂ emissions and reach net-zero. The game educates players on real-world environmental policies and how different initiatives impact the climate.

## 🎯 Motivation
Our goal was to create an engaging and educational tool that demonstrates how policy changes influence carbon emissions on a global scale. By simulating real-world emissions data and climate strategies, Luca allows players to explore and understand the complexities of reducing global CO₂ output.

## 🛠️ How It Works
Players purchase countries to take control of their environmental policies.
Each country has unique energy sources, economic constraints, and climate policies that affect emissions.
Players implement strategies such as switching to renewable energy, imposing carbon taxes, or investing in green technology.
The game simulates the effects of these decisions on global emissions, with the goal of reaching net-zero CO₂ output.

## 🚀 How to Run It
Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python (for backend/frontend)
MongoDB (database)
Installation & Setup
Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/conororor/Hackathon25.git

run HackathonGame.py

Ensure MongoDB is running locally or update the connection string in config.py.
Use MongoDB Atlas if hosting the database remotely.

## 🔮 Future Plans
Multiplayer Mode: Compete or collaborate with other players to fight climate change.
AI Opponents: Introducing AI-controlled players for more dynamic gameplay.
More Policy Options: Expanding decision-making choices for deeper strategy.
